# AI-Driven Drug Design (AIDD) Hub

This repository is a comprehensive resource hub for Computational Chemistry, with a special emphasis on AI-driven drug design.
It provides Python-based scripts, tools, and tutorials tailored for small molecule rational design.
The major topics will be:

* Machine Learning for Drug Discovery
* Molecular Dynamics Simulations
* Cheminformatics

Streamline your small molecule rational design workflows with practical examples and implementations.

# Features & Tools

### Drug Design & Discovery
* Python scripts for ligand docking, virtual screening, and pharmacophore modeling.
* ML and QSAR models for hit-to-lead screening, lead optimization and ADMET predictions.
* Structure-based and ligand-based drug design resources.

### Molecular Dynamics Simulations
* Automated scripts for running MD simulations with GROMACS and Amber.
* Tutorials for setup, execution and analysis of MD simulations.

### Cheminformatics
* Tools for molecular descriptor calculations, compound library management and data analysis.
* ML integration for predictive modeling in drug discovery.
